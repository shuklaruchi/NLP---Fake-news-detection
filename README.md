# NLP---Fake-news-detection
Data Science Project

Knowing the difference between fake and accurate news is essential. One approach is to have an expert make the decision and verify the accuracy of all the information, but this takes time and requires knowledge that cannot be shared. Second, we can automate the detection of bogus news using machine learning and artificial intelligence methods. Although there are many different unstructured formats of news content available online (including documents, videos, and audio), this article will focus on news in text format. We can now identify the deceptive and untrue nature of a statement thanks to advances in machine learning and natural language processing.
